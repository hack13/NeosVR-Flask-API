# NeosVR-Flask-API

### Install Requirements
```bash
python3 -m pip install --user -r requirements.txt
```

### Required Notes
1. Make sure you set the Variables at the top
  a. Set ServerName as your server (This is just used as reference)
  b. Set path to the folder where your docker-compose headlesses are
2. Make sure you headless name matches the folder name!!!
3. Please report bugs... 

This is a simple project to make things smoother for myself, but some others have said they wanna use it

### Todo List
- [ ] Add POST request support for Description and World Name
- [ ] Look at switching away from waitress (not everyone uses a reverse proxy in front of their API Hack...)
- [ ] Look at maybe making my life easier by using Glitfur's NeosVR-API Python Wrapper...
